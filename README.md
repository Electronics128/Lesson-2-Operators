# Lesson 2: Operators

Welcome to Lesson 2 of Intermediate Python! In this lesson, you will dive into Python's powerful operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise, and augmented assignment operators. By the end of this lesson, youâ€™ll have a deeper understanding of how to use these operators in various scenarios.

## Objectives:
- Learn to use arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators.
- Understand operator precedence.
- Explore special operators like `is`, `is not`, `in`, and `not in`.
- Practice augmented assignment operators for cleaner code.

## TODOs:
1. Perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and modulus.
2. Compare variables using comparison operators.
3. Work with logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) for condition evaluation.
4. Explore bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`).
5. Write expressions demonstrating operator precedence.
6. Use augmented assignment operators like `+=` and `**=`.
7. Test special operators for identity and membership.
8. Write a custom function utilizing modular arithmetic.
9. Solve a real-world problem involving operators.
10. Debug an expression with intentional operator misuse.

## How to Complete the Lesson:
1. Open the `lesson_02.py` file.
2. Complete each TODO section by implementing the required code.
3. Save the file and run it to test your code.

## How to Test Your Code:
To verify your solutions, run the test script:

```bash
python3 test_lesson_02.py
