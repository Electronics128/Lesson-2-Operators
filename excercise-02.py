# Lesson 2: Operators

# TODO 1: Arithmetic Operators:
# - Create variables `a = 10` and `b = 3`.
# - Perform and print results for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.

# TODO 2: Comparison Operators:
# - Compare `a` and `b` using all comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=).
# - Print the results of each comparison.

# TODO 3: Logical Operators:
# - Create boolean variables `x = True` and `y = False`.
# - Perform and print results for `x and y`, `x or y`, and `not x`.

# TODO 4: Bitwise Operators:
# - Use variables `a` and `b` and demonstrate bitwise AND, OR, XOR, left shift, and right shift.
# - Print the binary results for each operation.

# TODO 5: Operator Precedence:
# - Write an expression that combines arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators (e.g., `(a + b) > 10 and x`).
# - Print the result.

# TODO 6: Augmented Assignment Operators:
# - Use a variable `num = 5`.
# - Demonstrate `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `**=` operations.
# - Print the value of `num` after each operation.

# TODO 7: Special Operators:
# - Create two lists `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = list1`.
# - Use `is` and `is not` to compare the lists.
# - Use `in` and `not in` to check for membership in `list1`.
# - Print the results.

# TODO 8: Custom Operator Examples:
# - Write a function `mod_sum(a, b)` that returns `(a + b) % b`.
# - Call the function with various values and print the results.

# TODO 9: Real-World Example:
# - Create a variable `salary = 5000` and `bonus = 2000`.
# - Use arithmetic and logical operators to calculate and print the total income only if `bonus > 0`.

# TODO 10: Debugging with Operators:
# - Write an expression with intentional operator misuse.
# - Use print statements to debug and fix the issue.
